I can automate your morning coffee to streamlining your DevOps pipelines

What else do you need?

### My story

I'm a DevOps enthusiast with over five years of hands-on experience. But more importantly, I'm the kind of guy who loves solving problems and making everyone's life a bit easier - one script at a time.

#### Jack of All Trades, Master of Some

But, I have dabbled in a bit of everything, from DC to Cloud, from kubernetes to handling self managed onprem infrastructures but I have deep rooted knowledge about Kubernetes and PostgreSQL. If kubernetes was a art form, I'll be Picasso.

#### Team Player (Please not Microsoft teams)

I've led projects and teams, and I genuinely enjoy helping others grow. Plus, I bring donuts to meetings -- just saying.

I've spent years not just building systems, but also building teams and strategies. I believe good leadership is about empowerment and clear communication.

Seeing team members grow and suceed is one of the most rewarding part of the job for me.

I bring a mix of technical expertise and leadership skills to the table. With my background, I'm confident in taking roles that require both in-depth knowledge and the ability to guide a team towards success.
